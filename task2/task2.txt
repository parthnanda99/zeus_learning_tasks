1) explain the diffrent way in which css can be applied to HTML, what is prefered and why ?

CSS can be added to an HTML page in three ways:
1. Inline - Add style inside an HTML tag using style attribute to give styling.

 ex :- <div style="color:black;"> 

2.Internal - Inside <head> tag, add <style> tag and provide styling inside it.

 ex:- <style type="text/css"> 
  div { 
    color: red; 
  }  
 </style> 

3. External - You can do all styling of an HTML file in external CSS file and link that file to HTML page.
 External file should be linked in HTML page using <link> tag inside <head> tag.

 ex:-  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="path to your stylesheet" /> 

the best way for applying is External stylesheet file, because using that we manipulate full styling in proper way and no confusions are occuring in coding using external stylesheet.
